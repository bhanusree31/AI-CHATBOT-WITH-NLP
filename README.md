Introduction

A modular system for making chatbots that use a natural langauge model to converse.

Run the discord bot with python -m discord.main, or play around with the model on your terminal with python -m chatbot.gpt2.

Requirements

I only made a GPU requirements file, and havn't made a CPU-only one yet. Create a venv using python -m venv venv, activate it, and install the requirements file.
